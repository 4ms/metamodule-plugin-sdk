## Format of a plugin file


A MetaModule Plugin is an .mmplugin file, which is a tarball. The plugin.cmake script
takes care of this for you, but it can be useful to untar a plugin when debugging. To
view the contents of a plugin:

```bash
tar -xf MyPlugin.mmplugin
ls MyPlugin/
```

You will probably see files like this:
```bash
MyPlugin.so            # The plugin binary shared object
SDK-1.3                # Generated by plugin.cmake (empty file)
plugin.json            # Metadata: See above
plugin-mm.json         # Metadata: See above
faceplate-module1.png  # Everything below is the contents of 
faceplate-module2.png  # the assets/ directory
components/

...
```

All files inside the assets/ dir will be copied into the .mmplugin file.

When the plugin is loaded, all files will be copied into MetaModule RAM. RAM is
limited in size, so please be mindful of including files that are not used.
